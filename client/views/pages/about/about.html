        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Jaimie van Santen.</p>
        <p>I would like to become a software architect, dreaming Agile methodologies and singing DSL songs. I prefer open-source and collaboration. Having worked with Linux for a few years I also have experience in Linux system administration, which greatly improved my accuracy and speed as developer.</p>
